#MathematicalCalcuationMicroservice (Microservice #4)
#Authors: Dorit Dorsey & Kaedin Hanohano
#Language: Python 3
#Repository: https://github.com/doritnelson/MathematicalCalculationMicroservice
#Contributions:
#Dorit; completed the code and tested the code.
#Kaedin; completed the README and created the video

Instructions for running code in video:
1) Open 2 terminals and navigate to directory with code
2) Show text file is empty
3) In one terminal run "python calculation_test.py" and open text file to show how code has inserted code into text file
--Walk through text file to show that the request will ask the microservice to total, average and difference as well as test that it throws errors when it should.
4) Delete code in text file and show empty text file again
5) In the other terminal run "python mathematical_calculation_microservice.py" and show how text file is still empty even though microservice is running
6) Run "python calculation_test.py" and show how the text file has been updated to the results for the requests.
7) Show README
